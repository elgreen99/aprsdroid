APRSdroid - Geo-Location for Radio Amateurs

Fork of GeOrg's aprsdroid to change a few things that annoy me but aren't of general interest, such as being able to set the 
postfix for the call sign and having multiple profiles so I can flip between using my cell phone to transmit/receive position 
and using my packet radio to transmit/receive position depending upon which one has signal at a given time.
